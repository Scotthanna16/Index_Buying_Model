# Index_Buying_Model
This project uses a random forest model to predict whether you should be long or short on a given index. I use a number of factors, including data from the most prominent stocks in an index, to predict whether the index price will go up or down. I backtested this model using historical data not used in training, and it return 9.4% year over year.
